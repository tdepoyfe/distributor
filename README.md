# Distributor

A program to be run on a node so that it connect to one specified node upstream, 
accept any number of connections from downstream, and copy information sent from 
upstream to downstream.

This is a project to learn boost/asio, networking, and appropriate memory
management of shared buffers. Still needed: testing, benchmarking. Do not use as
is!
